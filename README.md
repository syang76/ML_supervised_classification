supervised_machine_learning_codes

ML_classification.py:
This code demonstrates how to construct pipelines to perform grid search and compare and performances (accuracy scores) of classifiers:  Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, and Random Forest.  Imputer and StandardScalar are used in the pipeline for preprocessing.

ML_regression.py:
This code demonstrates how to construct pipelines to perform grid search with 5-split KFold to compare performances (mean_squared_error) of regressors: Linear Regression, Decision tree, Random Forest, Gradient boosting. Imputer and StandardScalar are used in the pipeline for preprocessing.
